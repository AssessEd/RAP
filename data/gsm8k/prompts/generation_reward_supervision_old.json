    "input": "Problem: Four years ago, Kody was only half as old as Mohamed. If Mohamed is currently twice as 30 years old, how old is Kody?\nSolution: Mohamed is currently 30 * 2 = 60 years old.\nFour years ago, Mohamed must have been 60 - 4 = <<60-4=56>> 56 years old.\nKody was half as old as Mohamed four years ago. Thus, Kody was 56 / 2 = <<56/2=28>> 28 years old. Kody is currently 28 + 4 = <<28+4=32>> 32 years old.\n#### 32\n\nProblem: On a moonless night, three fireflies danced in the evening breeze. They were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies before two of the fireflies flew away. How many fireflies remained?\nSolution: The fireflies were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies, which are 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>> 8 fireflies.\nThree fireflies were dancing originally. They were joined by 8 fireflies before two of them flew away. So there were 3 + 8 - 2 = <<3+8-2=9>> 9 remaining.\n#### 9\n\nProblem: Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm. Ali gives her sister half of the total money he has and uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. Calculate the amount of money he has after buying the dinner.\nSolution: Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So he has 4 * 10 + 6 * 20 = <<4*10+6*20=160>> 160 dollars.\nAli gives half of the total money he has to his sister. So he gives 160 / 2 = <<160/2=80>> 80 dollars to his sister.\nAfter giving his sister the money, Ali has 160 - 80 = <<160-80=80>> 80 dollars left.\nAli uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. So he uses 80 * 3/5 = <<80*3/5=48>> 48 dollars to buy dinner.\nAfter buying the dinner, Ali has 80 - 48 = <<80-48=32>> 32 dollars left.\n#### 32\n\nProblem: A car is driving through a tunnel with many turns. After a while, the car must travel through a ring that requires a total of 4 right-hand turns. After the 1st turn, it travels 5 meters. After the 2nd turn, it travels 8 meters. After the 3rd turn, it travels a little further and at the 4th turn, it immediately exits the tunnel. If the car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring, how far did it have to travel after the 3rd turn?\nSolution: It travels 5 meters after the 1st, 8 meters after the 2nd, and 0 meters after the 4th turn. It's a total of 5 + 8 + 0 = <<5+8+0=13>> 13 meters.\nThe car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring. It travels 13 meters except for the 3rd turn. So it has to travel 23 - 13 = <<23-13=10>> 10 meters after the 3rd turn.\n#### 10\n\nProblem: Jasper will serve charcuterie at his dinner party. He buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10, a pound of cream cheese that cost half  the price of the cheddar cheese, and a pack of cold cuts that cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese. How much does he spend on the ingredients?\nSolution: A pound of cream cheese cost $10 / 2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.\nA pack of cold cuts cost $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.\nJasper spent $10 + $5 + $20 = $<<10+5+20=35>>35 on the ingredients.\n#### 35\n\nProblem: It is Roger\u2019s turn to provide a snack for the baseball team after the game and he has decided to bring trail mix. The trail mix comes in packs of 6 individual pouches. Roger has 13 members on his baseball team, plus 3 coaches and 2 helpers. How many packs of trail mix does he need to buy?\nSolution: Roger will need 13 + 3 + 2 = <<13+3+2=18>>18 pouches of trail mix. \nIf you divide the amount of trail mix pouches by the amount in each pack, 18 / 6 = <<18/6=3>>3 packs of trail mix.\n#### 3\n\n",

If Mohamed is currently twice as 30 years old, how old is Kody?\nSolution: Mohamed is currently 30 * 2 = 60 years old.\nFour years ago, Mohamed must have been 60 - 4 = <<60-4=56>> 56 years old.\nIs this partial solution correct? Yes. We need to know how old is Mohamed now to compute how old is Kody.\n\nProblem: Traci and Harris are baking cakes together. Traci has brought flour from her own house and Harris has 400g of flour in his house. Each cake needs 100g of flour and Traci and Harris have created 9 cakes each. How much flour, in grams, did Traci bring from her own house?\nSolution: Harris has 400g of flour in his house.\nIs this partial solution correct? Yes. The solution restates the known information.\n\nProblem: A quantity surveyor is figuring the construction costs for a couple that wishes to build a house. The costs are as follows: land costs $50 per square meter, bricks cost $100 per 1000 bricks and roof tiles cost $10 per roof tile. If the house they wish to build requires 2000 square meters, 10000 bricks, and 500 roof tiles, how much construction costs are required for this project?\nSolution: The cost required for buying land is $50/sq m * 2000 sq m = $<<50*2000=100000>>100000.\nThe cost required for buying bricks is $100/1000 bricks * 10000 bricks = $<<100/1000*10000=1000>>1000.\nThe cost required for buying roof tiles is $10/tile * 500 tiles = $<<10*500=100>>100.\nIs this partial solution correct? No. While we need to compute the cost of bricks and roof tiles to calculate the total construction costs, the line $10/tile * 500 tiles = $<<10*500=100>>100 is wrong it should read $10/tile * 500 tiles = $<<10*500=5000>>5000\n\nProblem: Wallace's water heater is twice the size of Catherine's water heater. If the capacity of Wallace's water heater is 40 gallons and it's 3/4 full, calculate the total number of gallons of water they both have if Catherine's water heater is also full with water to 3/4 of its capacity.\nSolution: When 3/4 full of water, Wallace's water heater has 3/4*40 = <<3/4*40=20>>20 gallons of water.\nIs this partial solution correct? No. The line 3/4*40 = <<3/4*40=20>>20 is wrong, it should be 3/4*40 = <<3/4*40=30>>30.\n\nProblem: There are 30 pieces of popcorn in a serving. Jared can eat 90 pieces of popcorn and his three other friends can each eat 60 pieces of popcorn. How many servings of popcorn should Jared order for all of them?\nSolution: Jared's friends can eat a total of 60 x 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 pieces of popcorn.\nJared and his three friends can eat a total of 180 + 90 = <<180+90=270>>270 pieces of popcorn.\nIs this partial solution correct? Yes. We need to compute how many pieces of popcorn Jared and his friends can eat.\n\nProblem: Sam and Drew have a combined age of 54. Sam is half of D7rew's age. How old is Sam?\nSolution: Let x be Drew's age.\nSam is (1/2)x, then x+(1/2)x=54. Hence (3/2)x=54 and 3x=108.\nTherefore x=<<36=36>>36\nSam is 36/2=<<36/2=18>>18 years old\nIs this partial solution correct? Yes. We found the solution to the original problem.\n\n",
